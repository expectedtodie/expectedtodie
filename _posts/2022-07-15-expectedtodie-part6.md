**Part 6: Radical Life Changes** 

This is part 6 of my blog series.  If you haven't read the previous parts in the series, it is best to start with part one, [Daddy's dying](https://expectedtodie.com/expectedtodie-part1).

By 2018, I had had chemo, radiation, and major surgery for my stage IV pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, and they appeared to be stable for now. 

One day, I stumbled upon a book in the library when I wasn’t even looking for a cancer book called “Radical Remission: Surviving Cancer Against all Odds” by Kelly A. Turner PhD.  Dr. Turner studied cancer survivors who managed to beat cancer.  Even stage IV cancer.  There are a number of very inspiring stories in her book.   People who had stage IV cancer and had reached the end of what the healthcare system could do for them but found a way to a cure on their own.  She identified 9 factors that all the survivors had in common: radically changing your diet, taking control of your health, following your intuition, using herbs and supplements, releasing suppressed emotions, increasing positive emotions, embracing social support, deepening your spiritual connection, and having strong reasons for living.   

Whoa, I’d already made some of these changes.  I had learned to take control of my health, to follow my (or my wife’s) intuition and with this crazy RV trip idea, had some strong reasons for living.   I was ready for more radical!

The common theme was that the body has amazing healing powers, all on its own.  The question was, how to tap into this power to cure my cancer?

The lesson I had started to learn was: “The body is a self-healing machine. Help it heal.”

Could I actually take actions that could cure an incurable cancer by giving my body, mind, and soul what they needed?

The first thing I did was to ask if just the plain-old healthy balanced diet was enough?  What was the most radical diet change I could make?  I was already reading “Chris Beat Cancer” which recommended a vegan diet, so why not vegan?  As a guy who never really liked vegetables, what could be more radical than vegan?!   

Now, I am not here to preach a vegan diet.  In the end, this did not work for me, but it may work for you.  What I am saying that worked for me was being open to new ideas and a mindset change and a change in habits.

So, what is the difference between a vegan and a vegetarian diet?   Eating vegetarian and vegan both mean abstaining from eating animal protein and meat.   But vegetarians may eat dairy, eggs, milk cheese and honey.   Vegans do not.   Just plant products.  So, what to eat?  Fortunately, my wife is an excellent cook and took pity on me and came up with interesting vegan dishes that were filling.    I also started “juicing” and eating organically, as recommend in the “Chris Beat Cancer” book.   This involved purchasing large quantities of fruits and vegetables at Whole Foods and stuffing them into my new juicing machine.  It takes a lot of fruits and vegetables to make one juice and it is pretty expensive too.   I found my favorite recipes here https://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/18061/drinks/juice.   Very tasty and my favorite part of eating vegan.

Lesson Learned: “What you eat is important in your healing. Be open to different ways of thinking about what a healthy diet is”

I will continue to discuss these life changes suggested in “Radical Remission”, but first let’s talk about the biggest life change of all.  

It was January 2019, and our new life was rapidly approaching. There was much to do. We were working hard to ready the house in Tampa, Florida for sale while urgently ridding ourselves of 30 years of stuff.   We hoped to have the house sold by June and with the proceeds, we planned to buy an RV, though we still weren’t sure what kind.  When we first planned this great adventure of quitting our jobs, selling our house, and embarking on a year-long RV trip across the US, we thought it would just be Michele and I.   Our daughter Taylor had graduated from Grad school and would soon be a licensed Occupational Therapist.  Our oldest son, Zach, would graduate from college in May and our youngest son, Jackson, would begin college at some Florida university.  We would be empty nesters.   

Or maybe not.

It turns out that everyone wanted to join us on our RV adventure.  How awesome to have all of our adult children with us!   But now we had to plan for five adults living full-time in an RV, and that meant a larger, more expensive RV with bunk beds.  We had a blast going to the massive annual RV show near our home in Tampa, but the options were overwhelming.

We got our house on the market in the spring, and had multiple offers within 2 days.  We were set to close on June 7.

That’s when we finally made the decision of what kind of RV.  Because I had never towed anything in my life and it seemed daunting to tow a 40-foot fifth wheel, we decided to go with a class A RV;  Those big ones you see on the road that look like a bus.   We found our new home, a 2011 Monaco Knight Diesel, purchased it within 10 days, and then we had to downsize our stuff even more to fit into it.  

I mentioned I was scared of towing a large fifth-wheel RV, but that’s not to say driving a huge beast like this wasn’t scary.  It was.  A lot.  You don’t have to have any special training or license to drive one and so we jumped in and took off.

But what about the cancer? What if the cancer grew? What if I needed some treatment of some kind? How can a cancer patient with stage IV cancer, stable or not, be so irresponsible?

If you have had advanced stage, incurable cancer, you know that life is short and precious.  It was time to live life.  F**k the cancer.  The only on-going treatment was a hormone shot that was supposedly helping to keep the cancer stable, so my wife learned how to give me the monthly injections, which made us self-sustaining.  I could always fly back to Florida for scans. 

Our one year of full-time RVing with no employment, turned into 16 months thanks to the pandemic.  Along the way, we dropped off Taylor in Idaho where she began her career as an Occupational Therapist.  Our son Zach left for an 8-month internship in Malaysia saving sea turtles, where he ended up spending lock-down on a remote island.  Not a bad way to spend lockdown. Jackson had begun on-line college and continued touring with us.  And then suddenly there were a plethora of remote jobs, and so, we were able to continue going while I worked!

But working in an RV 2 or 3 other people can be annoying.  And so, we sold the RV and Jeep, bought a pick-up truck and a small cargo trailer, and began moving from Airbnb to Airbnb every month. We still enjoyed all the amazing benefits of travel but got to live in nice houses.   We still do this today, over 3 years later.

Living a minimalist lifestyle, free from stuff, free from the burdens of homeownership with nothing but free time on weekends is amazing and quite low stress. We spend our free time exploring nature, hiking up mountains, in the desert, in the forest, and along alpine lakes and rivers.   Every weekend is an adventure.  I believe this lifestyle has told my body “This guy wants to live!” and is a big factor in beating cancer.   

Lesson Learned: “Don’t wait.  Live life to the fullest while you can!”

## Lessons Learned:

---

1: Focus on finding out what cancer you have before thinking about cutting it out.

2: Do not let them rush you.  Take your time and make good decisions.

3: Trust your instincts.  Don't be afraid to do something different than your doctor suggests.

4: Take time to find a specialist, especially if you have a rare condition.

5: Learn and get support from other patients going through what you are going through.

6: Question if the medications are necessary.  Is there some alternative? Consider the cause of the condition and see if there is anything that can be done to address the cause rather than treat the symptoms.

7: Doctors are not God.  They do not fully understand how the human body works and often are focused only on their specific area of expertise.

8: Do not rely solely on doctors.  Take control of your own healthcare.

9: It is important as a cancer patient to have something in the future to work towards, despite the cancer

10: The body is a self-healing machine. Help it heal.

11: What you eat is important in your healing. Be open to different ways of thinking about what a healthy diet is.

12: Don’t wait.  Live life to the fullest while you can!
