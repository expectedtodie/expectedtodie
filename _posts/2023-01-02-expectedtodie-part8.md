**Part 8: The results** 

This is part 8 of my blog series.  If you haven't read the previous parts in the series, it is best to start with part one, [Daddy's dying](https://expectedtodie.com/expectedtodie-part1).

While I was in Tampa, FL in December I went ahead and got an MRI scan at Moffitt Cancer Center.  Unfortunately, the results were not as I hoped.  There were still tumors on my pancreas and liver and they had grown a bit.  I also had another full-body PET scan, but this time it was able to detect my specific cancer anywhere in the body.  Fortunately, there was no additional cancer.

The Oncologist offered me two treatment options:
* Go back on Lanreotide, the shot I had stopped taking nearly 3 years ago
* Radical surgery

I did not even ask what the radical surgery was and told him surgery was out of the question as was any further radiation.   But I said I would try the Lanreotide shot again so I got one while I was there.  The side effects were much worse than I remembered.   I was basically unable to digest my food well and the diarrea was very bad for 10 days.  I could not sleep well and my brain wasn't functioning well.  I was tired a lot.  

As I measure all treatment effects on quality of life, I do not think I will be taking this shot again.

....more to come


## Lessons Learned:

---

1: Focus on finding out what cancer you have before thinking about cutting it out.

2: Do not let them rush you.  Take your time and make good decisions.

3: Trust your instincts.  Don't be afraid to do something different than your doctor suggests.

4: Take time to find a specialist, especially if you have a rare condition.

5: Learn and get support from other patients going through what you are going through.

6: Question if the medications are necessary.  Is there some alternative? Consider the cause of the condition and see if there is anything that can be done to address the cause rather than treat the symptoms.

7: Doctors are not God.  They do not fully understand how the human body works and often are focused only on their specific area of expertise.

8: Do not rely solely on doctors.  Take control of your own healthcare.

9: It is important as a cancer patient to have something in the future to work towards, despite the cancer

10: The body is a self-healing machine. Help it heal.

11: What you eat is important in your healing. Be open to different ways of thinking about what a healthy diet is.

12: Don't wait.  Live life to the fullest while you can!

13: Learn to recognize when stress is impacting your body and learn how to de-stress.
